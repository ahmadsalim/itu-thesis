itu-thesis
==========

An unofficial LaTeX document class for ITU theses. This is a work in progress -- please
send suggestions and bug reports should you be so bold as to use it!

Features
--------

 * Fancy title page with colorful ITU logo
 * Tasteful use of sans-serif to match general aesthetic of ITU
 * Bilingual - ITU logo + headers and title page take the language selected in babel (English or Danish).
 
TODO (that I plan to do)
------------------------
 * Make dependencies on non-free fonts optional
 * Further prettification
 * Show all the needed info on the title page

TODO (for someone else)
-----------------------
 * Make it work easily in LyX
